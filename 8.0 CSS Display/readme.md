## CSS Display

The **display property** has 3 possible values.

1. Block
2. Inline
3. Inline-Block

### Block

Block takes up the entire full width.
Another element is going to go into a completely new line.

### Inline

Inline is going to be fitted into the same line until the end of line is reached. Then they would go into the next line.

## Width & Height

Width and height cannot be set. Instead they will be determined by the size of the content.

### Inline-Block

Inline allows us to set elements in the same line.
Block allows us to set height and width.

### None

Any element on the screen that is set to none will disappear.
